1. What is software ?

- Software is a collection of information , instruction and data.

- Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. 
  It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. 
  

2. What is software engineering? 

- Software engineering is a concept in and of itself, but to better understand it, you need to know what each part of 
  the term means before you can fully understand how they operate together. 
  
- It can be difficult to understand, even though it does seem straightforward. That is because the pieces are more 
  complicated than many believe - and working with software engineering for an application is difficult and time-consuming.

   ->Software engineering has two parts: software and engineering.

      (1) Software is a collection of codes, documents, and triggers that does a specific job and fills a specific requirement.

      (2) Engineering is the development of products using best practices, principles, and methods.
      
      
3. Explain types of software ?

  ->(1) Application software 
  ->(2) System software
  ->(3) Programming software
  
  (1) Application software : 
  
                            - The most common type of software, application software is a computer software package that 
                              performs a specific function for a user, or in some cases, for another application.
                            - An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application 
                              for the user.
                            - Examples of Modern Applications include office suites, graphics software, databases and database 
                              management programs, web browsers, word processors, software development tools, image editors and 
                              communication platforms.
 
 (2) System software :
                           - These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware.
                           - System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software.
                           - It controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for 
                             all the other types of software to work in.
                           - The OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer programs.
                           - Other examples of system software include the firmware, computer language translators and system 
                             utilities....
                             
(3) Programming software : 
                           - Computer programmers use programming software to write code. Programming software and programming 
                             tools enable developers to develop, write, test and debug other software programs.
                           - Examples of programming software include assemblers, compilers, debuggers and interpreters.
                           
 
4.What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC 

- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology
with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.
