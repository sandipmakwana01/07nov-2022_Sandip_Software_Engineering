2. What is software engineering? 

- Software engineering is a concept in and of itself, but to better understand it, you need to know what each part of 
  the term means before you can fully understand how they operate together. 
  
- It can be difficult to understand, even though it does seem straightforward. That is because the pieces are more 
  complicated than many believe - and working with software engineering for an application is difficult and time-consuming.

   ->Software engineering has two parts: software and engineering.

      (1) Software is a collection of codes, documents, and triggers that does a specific job and fills a specific requirement.

      (2) Engineering is the development of products using best practices, principles, and methods.
