1. What is software ?

- Software is a collection of information , instruction and data.

- Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. 
  It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. 
  
- Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device.
 
- It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.

- The two main categories of software are application software and system software. 

- An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. 

- System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

- Other types of software include programming software, which provides the programming tools software developers need; 
  middleware, which sits between system software and applications; and driver software, which operates computer devices 
  and peripherals.

- Early software was written for specific computers and sold with the hardware it ran on. 

- In the 1980s, software began to be sold on floppy disks, and later on CDs and DVDs. 

- Today, most software is purchased and directly downloaded over the internet. 

- Software can be found on vendor websites or application service provider websites.

2. What is software engineering? 

- Software engineering is a concept in and of itself, but to better understand it, you need to know what each part of 
  the term means before you can fully understand how they operate together. 
  
- It can be difficult to understand, even though it does seem straightforward. That is because the pieces are more 
  complicated than many believe - and working with software engineering for an application is difficult and time-consuming.

   ->Software engineering has two parts: software and engineering.

      (1) Software is a collection of codes, documents, and triggers that does a specific job and fills a specific requirement.

      (2) Engineering is the development of products using best practices, principles, and methods.
