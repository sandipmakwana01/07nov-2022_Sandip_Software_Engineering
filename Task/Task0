1.Web browser vs search engine 

     Web browser

- (Definition) Web Browser uses the search engine to retrieve and view the 
               information from web pages present on the web servers.

- (Usage) Web Browsers are intended to Display the web page of the 
          current URL available at the server.

- (Installation) Many Web Browsers can be installed on our system.

- (Accessibility) Typically, all devices are supported.

- (Components) A web browser uses a graphical user interface to help users have
               an interactive online session on the Internet. 

- (Database) No database is required in Web browser. It contains only cache memory to store 
             cookies as well as browsing history until we remove it from our system.

- (Dependency) A browser is required to open a search engine. This means that the browser 
               is not reliant on the search engine.

- (History) Typically, search engines acquire information on their users and their search queries. 
            Some search engines, such as DuckDuckGo, do not gather user information.

- (Examples) Some of the widely used web browsers are: Mozilla Firefox, Netscape Navigator, 
             and Google Chrome.

      Search engine

- (Definition) A search engine is used to find the information in the World Wide Web and displays 
               the results at one place by returning web pages available on internet.

- (Usage) Search engine is intended to gather Information regarding several URL’s and to maintain it.

- (Installation) Search Engine need not to be installed on our system (i.e. comes as default).

- (Accessibility) The search engine is accessed through a web browser.

- (Components) The Search Indexer, Crawler, and Database are the three essential components of 
               a search engine.

- (Database) A search engine contains its own database.

- (Dependency) A search engine is not required to open the browser. This means that the search 
               engine is reliant on the browser.

- (History) Unless you actively clear this data or use a private browsing mode, browsers will retain 
            your browsing history, cookies, and cache in memory. 

- (Examples) Example of famous search engines are: Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckgo, Baidu Internet Explorer.



2. Error vs Bug  


      ERROR

- A mistake in coding/program is called Error.

- An error is a mistake,misconception,or misunderstanding 
  on the part of a software developer.
 
- In the category of the developer,we include software engineers,
  programmers, analysts, and testers.

- For example, 
  a developer may misunderstand a de-sign notation,or a programmer 
  might type a variable name incorrectly – leads to an Error.

- It is the one that is generated because of the wrong login, loop
  or syntax.
 
- The error normally arises in software; it leads to a change in the
  functionality of the program.

       BUG

- Reported Defect accepted by development team then it is called Bug.

- A bug is the result of a coding error.

- An Error found in the development environment before the product is
  shipped to the customer.

- A programming error that causes a program to work poorly, produce 
  incorrect results or crash.
 
- An error in software or hardware that causes a program to malfunction.

- A bug is the terminology of Tester.



3. HTTP vs HTTPs

              HTTP                                             

- HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

- HTTP is less secure.

- HTTP works in the application layer of OSI model.(7 layers of OSI model)

- HTTP does not uses certificate.

- There is no encryption and decryption.

   -Encryption is the process of translating plain text data(plaintext)into
    something that appears to be random and meaningless (cipherrtext).

   -Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.

- HTTP helps to transfer text, audio, video, images through webpages.

- An application protocol for distributed, collaborative and hyper media information system.

- HTTP URLs begin with http://.

- It uses port 80 by default.


              HTTPs

- HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.

- HTTPs is more secure.

- HTTPs works in the transport layer of OSI model.

- HTTPs uses SSL(Secure Socket Layer) certificate.

- There is encryption and decryption

- HTTPS helps to transfer data securely via network.

- An extension of HTTP protocol for secure communication over a network.

- HTTP URLs begin with https://.

- It uses port 443 by default.

- HTTPS is also called combination of HTTP+ SSL (Secure Socket Layer)



4. TCP / IP 

           TCP

- (Definition) TCP provides the service of exchanging data between applications.

- (Connection) Connection Oriented.

- (location) Transport.

- (Reliability) Reliable.

- (Transfer) Segments to internet layer.

- (Flow control) Yes.

- (Format) TCP segments have a 20 byte header with >= 0 bytes of data.

           IP 

- (Definition) IP handles addressing and routing messages to the computers across 
               one or more networks.

- (Connection) Connection less method.

- (location) Internet.

- (Reliability) Unreliable.

- (Transfer) Datagrams to physical level.

- (Flow control) No.

- (Format) IP datagrams contain a message, or one fragment of a message, that may be 
           up to 65,535 bytes (octets) in length



TCP/IP Protocol Layers

 -Application Layer
 -Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
 -Internet Layer (IP)
 -Network Layer (ARP)


5. What is Internet

   The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks.
 - a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, 
   get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers).
